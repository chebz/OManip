This is my implementation of object manipulation using world space UI controls.
Click on the object to bring up tool menu. If menu is too small move closer to the object.
While this is using mouse cursor, with VR the cursor would be replaced with a hand. 
Interaction can then be tracked in 3D space when the hand is intersecting with the object's collider.

Controls:
WASD - fly camera
RMB (hold) - pan camera
Left click on object - bring up tool menu
